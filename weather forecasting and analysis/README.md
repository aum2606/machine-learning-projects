# Project Title: Weather Analysis and Forecasting

**Description**

This project involves analyzing and forecasting weather patterns using historical weather data. The notebook provides a comprehensive data pipeline that reads, processes, and analyzes weather data for long-term forecasting. The project utilizes data visualization and machine learning techniques to analyze trends, generate insights, and predict future weather patterns.
Project Structure

The notebook follows a clear structure to load, preprocess, analyze, and forecast weather data:

    Data Loading and Preparation: Loads weather data from a CSV file, parses dates, and extracts features like day, month, and hour.
    Data Preprocessing: Performs data normalization, scaling, and basic cleaning.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes weather data patterns and distributions to gain insights.
    Feature Engineering: Generates additional features to improve model performance.
    Modeling and Forecasting: Implements machine learning models to forecast weather conditions based on historical data.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-Learn

Installation

     Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/weather-analysis-forecasting.git
cd weather-analysis-forecasting

# Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preparation: Ensure the data file (cleaned_weather.csv) is available in the input directory.
    Run Notebook: Open the notebook weather-analysis-forecasting.ipynb and run each cell in sequence.

Code Details

1. Data Loading and Preparation

The function data_loading_and_preparing() reads and preprocesses the weather data, adding hour, day, and month columns for enhanced analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze trends.

3. Forecasting

Several models are used to forecast weather patterns over a defined period, using features engineered from the time-series data.
